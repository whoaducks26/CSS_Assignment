## Project Instructions

### Usage of libraries
- Usage of libraries is highly encouraged but not mandatory
- When adding a library, indicate why you have chosen the library and what purpose it serves
- Since React itself is a JavaScript library that students are integrating into the web application they are building, this is the bare minimum that they should be able to work with. However, the module only covers a very limited subset of functionality and features that the React library offers (to name a few: useContext, server components, memoization).
- As we're working with the Next.js framework, this is another library where students are also encouraged to utilize more features that it offers than those already taught in class, to accomplish additional features.

### Interactive Features
- Students are to make their pages interactive, such that users can interact with it.
- Students are strongly encouraged to have input fields and buttons on the page as elements that the users can interact with. This is not a mandatory requirement, since it is possible for the page to receive user interaction even without the use of page elements.

### Non-interactive Features
- Students are also encouraged to explore the following non-interactive features:
    - Component or UI libraries
    - Data fetching from external APIs
    - Browser storage API
    - Pages that work offline (on subsequent visits)

### Code Ownership
- When creating or editing a page or component, students are to indicate their name and the changes they have made as a comment at the top of the file.
- On top of that, students are to list out the code files they have created within the reflection. Files not listed will not be taken into consideration for grading

### Reflection
- No page or word limit
- The purpose of the reflection is to have students explain their design decisions, such as why a certain JavaScript library was chosen to be integrated (perhaps it helps fulfill a particular feature much more easily).
- Any decisions taken that are not appropriate to be left within the source code files itself should be written here, as well as a walkthrough on how to use the features on the page.
- Students can also choose to talk about any difficulties faced while embarking on the project, and if they worked together with any other member for a feature.
- Any references made should also be listed here. No particular citation format is mandated, but please ensure that it is neat, tidy, and easy to read.

## Grading

### Marking Criteria
![Marking Criteria](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1537e70f-adf5-4866-8b52-83162937091c)

### Deductions
- Non-adherence to any of the listed criteria in the aforementioned sections may result in a deduction of marks from the individual and/or group component.
- Here is an additional list (non-exhaustive) of basic coding practices that students should ensure are followed:
    - Information included in the webpages should be relevant
    - Deprecated HTML elements should not be used
        - MDN documentation will indicate if it has been deprecated
    - Files are well organized
        - Media files should be kept within the public folder (unless there is a good reason not to, e.g. restricting public access)
    - Unused code should be removed from the submission
        - Any files with code that is not called by others
        - Libraries that no one is using should not be listed in package.json
- Students may additionally refer to a style guide from reputable organizations for good coding practices. Some of these will have been covered in class, but do take the chance to explore others, as well as discuss them within the group to discuss common adoption. Some possible style guides have been listed below.

## Fetching of data

### Fetching data from external sources
- Students are strongly encouraged to explore the functionality of data fetching, to work with making API calls from external sources.
- A possible resource for data is the Singapore Government's data.gov.sg website, which has a collection of real-time APIs that students may call for metrics such as the PSI or weather forecast. There's also geospatial data (locations) that can be used to plot out an interactive map or searching system. Another resource is the historical data sets in the form of csv files, where an interactive dashboard could be made to search this data, which could be filtered by parameters such as date and locations.
- The LTA Datamall is another possible source for real-time APIs, though a free account is required for an API key.

### Sharing of API Keys
- Students are to submit API keys for any API calls the app makes, that require one.
- If students are not comfortable with sharing such keys within the team, please send them to the tutor directly.
- Do note that it is still possible to revoke or regenerate (get a new API key). Make sure to only do so after the submission has been graded.
- Please do not misuse the API keys of another student shared for the purposes of the assignment.

## Creditation

### Acknowledgement of pictures/videos
Students are to give credit to the author of any non-Creative Commons media, such as pictures or videos, utilized in the project. Students are encouraged to utilize Creative Commons media whenever possible.
